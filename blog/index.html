				<p>Why would anyone put money behind a new approach to supporting open independent journalism back in early 2016?</p>

				<p>Crowdfunding platforms for journalism were closing shop. Brexit and Trump were still merely subplots in the media hivemind. And fake news was just a pesky buzz in people's ears.</p>

				<p>Everything was fine, right?</p>

				<p>Except everything wasn't fine.</p>

				<p>We knew this. Everyone who cared about journalism knew this.</p>

				<p>And only a small number of foundations committed to the future of independent voices were willing to back new ideas that might give journalism the means to thrive the way it should.</p>

				<p>But we persevered and eventually found a partner who could make Publish.org possible.</p>

				<p>Yes, Publish.org is on!</p>

				<p>Thanks to the support of Open Society Foundations we are now ready to kick things off and to start building. We've been doing research talking to some of you, and we had a big planning session this week.</p>

				<p>Development is starting today!</p>

				<p>Just like our previous work at Contributoria we will have lots of ways for people to get involved. There's a reason we're using a .org domain.</p>

				<p>We'll start sharing our plans, too. For now, we just wanted to say, "we're back!" and to thank you for your patience.</p>

				<p>We didn't intend to stay so quiet for so long. If we had the steering wheel for the year that was 2016 we would've taken it down a very different path. But here we are now with an idea, a plan, some financial support and all of you to help us create a healthier and longer-lasting life for independent journalism.</p>

				<p>The future is looking very bright indeed.</p>

          <h2 class="date">18 Nov 2015</h2>
          <h2 class="post_title">What we're doing, and how we'll get there</h2>
          <h3 class="author">By Matt McAlister</h3>

          <p>
            <img class="post_header_image" src="/images/blog_image_1.jpg" />
          </p>

          <p>
            We're thrilled to be sharing our progress with you, as we build <a href="//publish.org">Publish.org</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step in starting up this new organisation was to get a great domain, establish a new visual identity and set up a home page on the Internet where people could sign up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is just the beginning, and we’ll keep posting updates like this as we build this exciting new business.
          </p>
          <p>
            What may not be obvious from the outside is that before we could do the stuff you've seen already we had to decide what kind of company we wanted to be. The team had only a couple of short discussions about that because we spent the last two years working together on something you may already know about. It was called Contributoria. We knew exactly what we wanted <a href="//publish.org">Publish.org</a> to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mission here is simple - to support journalism in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's all that matters. As long as we're meeting that aim then <a href="//publish.org">Publish.org</a> is successful, as far as we're concerned.
          </p>

          <h3>So, how do we get started?</h3>

          <p>
            The first question to resolve before we could choose a name for the company was about money. We will make more than we spend over time, but what should we do with the profits?
          </p>
          <p>
            We all felt strongly that the point in making money in journalism is to pay for more journalism. So, we set up the company as a nonprofit. And we chose a .org instead of a .com.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, we were able to buy <a href="//publish.org">Publish.org</a>, and now here we are.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="//publish.org">Publish.org</a> will be a UK-based Community Interest Company or C.I.C., similar to a B-Corp in the US but with more stringent requirements on reinvestment. As a CIC, up to about one third of the organisation's operating surplus can be used in traditional ways such as paying dividends to shareholders. But the other two thirds of "profits" must be reinvested into the community we serve. The company's assets are held in what they call an "asset lock".
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything we do is to support journalism, and our company structure codifies that in law. The community is the only "shareholder" that matters to us.
          </p>

          <h3>What's different?</h3>

          <p>
            We've been asked by our friends and families what's different about <a href="//publish.org">Publish.org</a>. Our ownership structure is the big difference, so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not owned by traditional media. There are no investors to please or exit strategies to worry about. We can always put the community first. In fact, we are obligated to do what's right for the community. We have a lot of ideas on how to go about doing that.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're going to apply things we learned doing Contributoria and do them better. We will work with sponsors to support topic coverage. And we will work with more media outlets to distribute stories. We also have some ideas about incubating and spinning out for-profit companies that share our mission. There are a lot of ways to support journalism in the world.
          </p>

          <h3>Funding</h3>

          <p>
            We're going to fund all this exciting activity by working with foundations that care about journalism as much as we do. We're also going to raise money from our community. We will be seeking donations through crowdfunding campaigns and membership drives.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's an ambitious plan, but our mission is big and it deserves some ambitious action.
          </p>

          <h3>Spread the word</h3>

          <p>
            A lot of people have asked how to help us. The first thing we need to do is build connections. We need followers on <a href="//www.facebook.com/PublishOrg/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://publish.org/contact">newsletter subscribers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are starting from scratch here, and it will help us a lot to have a connected community of people who care about journalism to talk to when we have things we want to talk about.
            So, please, tell people to keep an eye out for <a href="//publish.org">Publish.org</a>. Share our posts on Facebook. Forward our emails to your friends and family. Help us create the community you want to be a member of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for your ongoing support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matt, Sarah, Dan, and Dean
          </p>
